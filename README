  Zookeeper Experiments
-------------------------
This repository gathers programs based on the Apache Zookeeper coordination middleware (http://zookeeper.apache.org).

Programs list:
  - Alphabet server (called Telex for now...): A publisher thread sends the alphabet on a distributed queue. Clients on the queue get the letters and put them on the stdout.

Context:
These experiments are part of self-studies and a research project on software verification. The programs should be generic enough to, perhaps, be used elsewhere. Feedbacks are welcome to improve or extend them! This code is license-free and provided "as-is".

-------------------------
Telex, an alphabet server
-------------------------
Usage:
  - Start a ZooKeeper server on localhost, port 2181 (see, e.g., a standalone operation on http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.3/zookeeperStarted.html).
  - From the root directory of the present code, run ant.

The default execution creates 1 publisher and 2 clients. There is only a single publisher for now. The number of clients is a parameter of the main class.
